<h3>Current Feature List:</h3>

- Smooth Head:            Smooths your head movement and also adds some more depth to it's movement as well
- Smooth Head + Neck:     Similar to Smooth Head but also takes into account a neck bone to they are integrated well
- Eye Movement:           Easy to add Eye movement that can work on basically any general eye shape through the use of parabolic curves.
- Blink script:           Just a simple script that runs a specified blink animation when needed
- Ear Physics:            This will add physics to your ears when you move, jump, crouch, or move your head, and it also adds a disableable ear flick animation randomly for added depth.
- Tail Physics:           This will add phsycis to your tails when you spin, move, jump, etc. Has capabilites for wag modification, and is very versatile in how you'd like to control it.
- Tiddy Physics:          A simple to modify bewb physic script, with configurable bodaciousness.
- Animated Texture script:A simplified script for animated textures so you don't have to give yourself a headache.
- FP hand adjust:         A simple script that just moves the first person hand.
- Centaur Body Physics:   Have a centaur body? With some correct pivot stucturing you can get your centaur body to move accurately when jumping and falling.
- Crouch Animation:       A simple script that can either have a specific crouch pose, or better yet have an animation for crouching and uncrouching.
- Walk/Run animations:    This allows you to smoothly play walk and run animations without snapping.
- Floating Points:        These are points that will float to a designated position rather than just follow a players movement. Good for stuff like fairies, pets, miscelanious floating objects, or floaty avatar models. 
- Bounce Walk:            This will make your avatar slightly bounce when you walk, good for smaller cuter models to make them look like they're hopping around(also affects physics of other objects)
- Smooth Torso:           This will make your body/torso move smoothly based on where you are looking to make it look like your avatar is bending in the direction

<h4>More advanced features if you know what you're doing:</h4>

- Control Variables:      variables that control certain aspects like eye scale, blink enabling, tailwag, etc. that can be modified in your script. good for emotes.
- Linear Graph:           returns y value of input t value of the linear graph between two points
- Parabolic Graph:        returns y value of input t value of the parabolic graph between three points
- Bounce Object:          creates a bounce object that when doBounce is run will bounce towards a target smoothly based on preset settings.
