- Linear Graph:           returns y value of input t value of the linear graph between two points
- Parabolic Graph:        returns y value of input t value of the parabolic graph between three points
- Bounce Object:          creates a bounce object that when doBounce is run will bounce towards a target smoothly based on preset settings.
